					<li class="quiz">Amazingly, he owns an ice cream truck!</li>
					<li class="quiz">Similar to his large family in Harry Potter, Rupert is the eldest of five children.</li>
					<li class="quiz">Rupert joined a local theatre school and was cast as a fish in <span>Noah’s Ark</span> and a donkey in another play.</li>
					<li class="quiz">Like his co-star Emma Watson, Rupert had never acted professionally before Harry Potter.</li>

					<li class="quiz">Although not intended at the start, Ron is inspired by J.K Rowling’s best friend.</li>
					<li class="quiz">Ron’s insecurities come from a number of factors, those being: he is not an excellent Quidditch player nor a noteworthy study, he was not the daughter his mother always dreamt of and often although not purposefully he is overshadowed by Harry’s fame.</li>
					<li class="quiz">Before Ron begins his adult life working as an Auror in the Ministry and Magic, he joins Fred and George at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, a shop which becomes a huge success.</li>
					<li class="quiz">In the final instalment Ron and Hermione are married with two children called Rose and Hugo.</li>
